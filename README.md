This project contains XSLT files to extract the attribute tables from DICOM part 6 and 
part 7 and convert to the Javascript data dictionary format used by https://github.com/chafey/dicom2ion-js.

To use:
* Get a copy of the DICOM part 6 and part 7 XML files from http://www.dicomstandard.org/current
  * [Part 6](http://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/source/docbook/part06/) contains
    * Chapter 6. Registry of DICOM Data Elements
    * Chapter 7. Registry of DICOM File Meta Elements
    * Chapter 8. Registry of DICOM Directory Structuring Elements
    * Chapter 9. Registry of DICOM Dynamic RTP Payload Elements
  * [Part 7](http://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/source/docbook/part07/) contains
    * Chapter E. Command Dictionary including E.1. Registry of DICOM Command Elements and E.2 Retired Command Fields
* Place the DICOM files part06.xml and part07.xml in the project directory.
* Run the two tasks configured as part of the project, one to parse each file, and generate part06.js and part07.js.
* Alternatively invoke the XSLT files from your favourite tool or the commandline.

Note: the generated files are not quite ready for direct use:
* They aren't quite proper Javascript (missing opening and closing matter)
* There are breaks in the files between content generated by each source table (4 sections in the part 6 file, 
2 sections in the part 7 file). This is intentional until a mechanism can be found to merge both files, and sort the content.

To modify the xslt files, the VS Code extension [XSLT Interactive Debugger](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=philschatz.vscode-xslt) may be useful.
